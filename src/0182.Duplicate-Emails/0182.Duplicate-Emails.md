# 自己写的

```sql
select  email, Count(id) from Person group by email having  Count(id) >1
```

先计算 每个 email 出现的次数
最后 再加  having Count(id) >1 

# 其他

1. Use self join.
   
   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
   FROM Person a JOIN Person b
   ON (a.Email = b.Email)
   WHERE a.Id <> b.Id
   ```

2. Use subquery with [EXISTS](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/exists-and-not-exists-subqueries.html):
   
   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT a.Email
   FROM Person a
   WHERE EXISTS(
       SELECT 1
       FROM Person b
       WHERE a.Email = b.Email
       LIMIT 1, 1
   )
   ```

3. Basic idea is this query:
   
   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT Email FROM Person
   MINUS
   (SELECT Id, Email FROM Person GROUP BY Email)
   ```
   
   But since MySQL does not support MINUS, we use LEFT JOIN:
   
   ```
   SELECT DISTINCT a.Email FROM Person a
   LEFT JOIN (SELECT Id, Email from Person GROUP BY Email) b
   ON (a.email = b.email) AND (a.Id = b.Id)
   WHERE b.Email IS NULL
   ```
