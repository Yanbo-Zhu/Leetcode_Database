# 要点

- 不能两个 Group function 嵌套使用
  
  - ```sql
    Select O1.customer_number , Max(Count(O1.order_number)) FROM  Orders AS O1 Group by customer_number
    ```
  
  - count(\*\) and count(1)
    
    - count(\*\) means it will count all records i.e each and every cell 
    - count(1) means it will add one pseudo column with value 1 and returns count of all records
    - 这两个返回的结果的值是一样的 ， 就是得到 table 的总行数 
  
  - limit: 限制输出的 条目 

# 自己写的

没想出来 

```sql
Select O1.customer_number , Count(O1.order_number) FROM  Orders AS O1 Group by customer_number 
```

# 别人写的

## 方法1

```sql
select customer_number from orders
group by customer_number
order by count(*) desc limit 1;

等效于 
Select O1.customer_number, Count(O1.order_number)  FROM  Orders AS O1 
Group by customer_number order by Count(O1.order_number) DESC lIMIT 1
```

Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

Do not use triangle join, because it is bad scalibility and performance

Step:

1. Find the number of the largest count on order number
2. Select the customer who has same number of order as the largest count on order number

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
Group BY customer_number
HAVING  count(order_number) = 
(SELECT max(numOfOrder)
FROM
    (SELECT customer_number,count(order_number) as numOfOrder
    FROM orders
    Group By customer_number) as temp)
```

## 方法2

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
Group BY customer_number
HAVING  count(order_number) = 
(SELECT max(numOfOrder)
FROM
    (SELECT customer_number,count(order_number) as numOfOrder
        FROM orders
        Group By customer_number
    ) as temp
)


SELECT customer_number 
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING count(order_number) = (
    SELECT count(order_number)
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
    ORDER BY count(order_number) DESC LIMIT 1
)
```

方法3

```sql
select customer_number from orders 
group by customer_number
having count(customer_number) >= all 
(select count(customer_number) from orders group by customer_number)
;
```
