Table: `Person`

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

Write an SQL query to **delete** all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`. Note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
**Output:** 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
**Explanation:** john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

# 自己写的

都不对 

```sql
DELETE P1 FROM Person P1 
Inner Join Person P2 WHERE phone LIKE '%9';

DELETE P1 FROM Person P1 where NOT EXISTS ( select 1 from Person P2 group by P2.email )
```

# 其他

## 方法1

```sql
delete from Person
where id not in (
                select id 
                from
                    (select min(id) as Id,Email
                    from Person
                    group by Email
                    order by Id) AS i
                )
```

为什么写成这样就不行 （如下）

```sql
DELETE p FROM Person p WHERE p.id IN 
(SELECT p1.id FROM Person p1 GROUP BY p1.Email HAVING COUNT(1)>1);
```

因为 

- you will be noted " You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause "
- you can  not use target table in where clause with delete or update sentence. In order to resolve this problem, you can package select sentence's result as a new table
- MySQL Don't allow referring delete target table in sub query, a workaround is use ( select * from Person ) to get a new table.
- In mysql you must not update a table while using select clause , You can only do that step by step . However ,you can use a middle table as

## 方法2

```sql
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND
p1.Id > p2.Id
```
