Table: `Employee`

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
**Output:** 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
**Explanation:** Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

# 0. Only main Query solution

```sql
select e.Name as Employee
from Employee e, Employee m
where e.ManagerId is not NULL and
e.ManagerId = m.ID and e.Salary > m.Salary
```

# 1. Sub-query solution

```sql
SELECT Name as Employee FROM Employee e
WHERE Salary > (
    Select Salary FROM Employee m WHERE m.Id = e.ManagerId
)
```

**Advantages Of Subquery:**

- Complex query can be broken down into a series of logical steps.
- Subquery is easy to read, understand and maintain.
- It allow to use the results of another query in the outer query.

**Disadvantages of Subquery:**

- Execution is slower than JOIN. <font color=red>(比较慢)</font>
- We cannot modify a table and select from the same table within a subquery in the same SQL statement.

# 2. JOIN solution

```sql
SELECT
     a.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee AS a JOIN Employee AS b
     ON a.ManagerId = b.Id
     AND a.Salary > b.Salary
;
```

**Advantage of a JOIN**

- Execution and retrieval time faster than subqueries.<font color=red>(比较快)</font>

**Disadvantages Of JOIN:**

- Database server has to do more work when it comes to a lot of joins in a query => more time consuming to retrieve data
- Developer can be confused to choose the appropriate type among many types of joins. <font color=red>(需要阅读更多的数据)</font>

# 3. Conclusion:

Most developers prioritize speed optimizing while others prioritize logic. It ups to you in your specific case
