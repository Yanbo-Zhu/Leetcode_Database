Table: `Activity`

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

Write an SQL query to report the **first login date** for each player.

Return the result table in **any order**.





The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
**Output:** 
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+



# 自己写的

```sql
Select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login  from Activity group by player_id
```

- 记住 这里 应该用的是  player_id 去 group by, 不是 event_date

# 别人的

下面的两个方法 都用到了  

- 窗口函数 partition by

- 专用的窗口函数： rank(), dense_rank(), row_number(), first_value() 等专用窗口函数

## 方法1

```sql
select 
player_id,
first_login
from (
    select 
    player_id, 
    event_date first_login,
    dense_rank() over(
        partition by player_id
        order by event_date
    ) poz
    from Activity
) src
where
poz = 1;
```

- More complicated but ~80 ms faster

## 方法2

```sql
select player_id,event_date as first_login 
from (
  select player_id, event_date,
  rank() over(
      partition by player_id order by event_date
      ) as rank_no
from Activity ) m
where rank_no = 1
```

## 方法3

```sql
select  distinct player_id, first_value(event_date) over(partition by player_id order by event_date) first_login from Activity;
```
