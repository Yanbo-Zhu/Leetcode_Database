## Table: `Orders`

+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

&nbsp;

Write an SQL query to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed **the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

## **Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
**Output:** 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
**Explanation:** 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.

**Follow up:** What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?

# 要点

- 不能两个 Group function 嵌套使用. 比如 max() 和 count() 不能嵌套使用 
  
  - ```sql
    Select O1.customer_number , Max(Count(O1.order_number)) FROM  Orders AS O1 Group by customer_number
    ```
  
  - count(\*\) and count(1)
    
    - count(\*\) means it will count all records i.e each row, each column and every cell 
    - count(1) means it will add one pseudo column with value 1 and returns count of all records
    - 这两个返回的结果的值是一样的 ， 就是得到 table 的总行数 
  
  - limit: 限制输出的 条目 
  
  - The ALL Operator:
    
    - returns a boolean value as a result
    - returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition 
    - is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements

# 自己写的

没想出来 

```sql
Select O1.customer_number , Count(O1.order_number) FROM  Orders AS O1 Group by customer_number 
```

# 别人写的

## 方法1

```sql
select customer_number from orders
group by customer_number
order by count(*) desc limit 1;

等效于 
Select O1.customer_number, Count(O1.order_number)  FROM  Orders AS O1 
Group by customer_number order by Count(O1.order_number) DESC lIMIT 1
```

## 方法2

```sql
SELECT customer_number 
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING count(order_number) = (
    SELECT count(order_number)
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
    ORDER BY count(order_number) DESC LIMIT 1
)
```

## 方法3

```sql
select customer_number from orders 
group by customer_number
having count(customer_number) >= all 
(select count(customer_number) from orders group by customer_number)
;
```

# 题设变种

Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?

Do not use triangle join, because it is bad scalibility and performance

Step:

1. Find the number of the largest count on order number
2. Select the customer who has same number of order as the largest count on order number

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
Group BY customer_number
HAVING  count(order_number) = 
(SELECT max(numOfOrder)
FROM
    (SELECT customer_number,count(order_number) as numOfOrder
    FROM orders
    Group By customer_number) 
as temp
)
```
